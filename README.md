# Guess The Number - Global Edition 🌍

An interactive Android game where the player tries to guess a hidden number thought of by the computer. This project showcases advanced Android localization and AI-assisted development.

## 🎮 How it Works
1. The computer randomly selects a hidden number between **1 and 99**.
2. The player has **10 attempts** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the app provides feedback:
    - Indicates if the hidden number is **higher** or **lower**.
    - Displays a random, fun "shout" (e.g., "Nope!", "Almost had it!", "Ice cold!") to keep the game engaging.
4. Players can switch languages instantly at any time via the top menu.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Kotlin-based Architecture**: Clean and maintainable code.
- **Dynamic Locale Switching**: Change languages on the fly using `AppCompatDelegate` without restarting the app.
- **AI-Powered Localization**: Leveraged **Google Gemini Code Assist** to translate the app into 22 world languages accurately.
- **Material 3 UI**: Modern and responsive design.
